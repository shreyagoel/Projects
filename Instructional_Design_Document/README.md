# Instructional Design Document

Technical Academic Project at Teachers College

Built an advanced instructional design document for a programming course in HTML and CSS for HigherEducation Learners or Adult Learners.

### Skills Used: 
Research, Instructional Design, Learning Theories, Designing Goals of a Course, Designing Evaluation, Word, PowerPoint, HTML

Worked on the entire project collectively over a period of 8 weeks to complete the project using digital tools (like google hangout and google docs) to meet and complete the tasks.

The document includes the design of advanced instructional program that can be run completely online. It aims to make the individuals self dependent after the course by teaching them to use tools and technologies like slack, github, stack over flow etc. It involves a well thought about and advanced evaluation scheme for a online program that the current competing projects do not support.
