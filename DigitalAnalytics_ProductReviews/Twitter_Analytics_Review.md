## Twitter_Analytics

### How would you define Twitter Analytics?
Twitter Analytics is a digital analytics tool that has quite a few interesting things in store from a Business standpoint or just generally for someone who uses twitter for social networking. It's free version includes KPIs like overall page performance, tweet performance, user engagement, hashtag monitoring, video performance and audience profile in a easy to read manner. 

### What do you like best?
Two things: First, its user friendly. Its UI is designed like a dashboard which gives the user insights and trends for the past 28 days in one place along with the current audience profile that currently follows the twitter handle. Second, the ability to export raw data, although it is limited but I can pull data on tweets and videos to further apply NLP and generate product specific digital analytics reports.

### What business problems are you solving?
Currently, I am looking at how the digital campaigns have performed in the past 4 months for specific products. Twitter Analytics gives me an idea of how the user is interacting with tweets for different products, if there is a significant difference in trends between products, and finally gives me how to help the digital team in planning their future tweets.

### What is your primary role when using this product?
As a Digital Marketing Data Analyst, my primary role is to generate product specific monthly reports that focus on how much traffic did twitter drive to the company website and our twitter profile and further figure out how to blend it with the internal data. Further, archiving this data in its raw form with added features is something that gets done along the line for future research and year on year analysis.

### At which company did you most recently use this product?
Lindblad Expeditions - National Geographic

### Are you a current user of Twitter Analytics?
