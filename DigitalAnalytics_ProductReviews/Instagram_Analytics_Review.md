# Instagram Analytics


### How would you define Instagram Analytics?
Instagram Analytics is a digital analytics feature that you can activate with quite a few products available in the market. It's not an inbuilt feature within Instagram and must be activated on a third-party account like Iconosquare. The one I have worked with is Iconosquare (https://pro.iconosquare.com/). It is easy to use. Helps export data easily. Gives me the feature to track competitors and partner pages.

### Why Iconosquare?
I would say why not, it makes my life easy by giving me interactive dashboards, gives me the overview there and then, lets me export data, andd much more. It can do much more than just analytics and can help the digital team schedule and post their Instagram content as well. So why not?

### What business problems are you solving?
Currently, I am looking at how the digital campaigns have performed over the year so far, and how we can gain more followers, get more website clicks and figure out which of the photographers if tagged help us reach a bigger audience. It is a very general idea of digital analytics.

### Who are the stakeholders and what do you report to them?
The major stakeholders are the Digital Marketing Team and Product Marketing Managers.

For the **Product Marketing Managers**, I have so far developed monthly and quarterly report that helps them get a view of how posts related to their products have performed. I am prepared to answer any requests on any type of Campaigns through Instagram.

For the **Digital Marketing Team**, I have created a extensive dashboard that will help them with understanding the audience behavior with their monthly posts, monthly stories, give them the number of website clicks, followers, change in followers, engagement level, Tagged account analysis on how the posts behave with them for monthly, quarterly or yearly analysis depending on the relevance to the area of focus.

### What more is possible according to you that you did not perform with your current project and why did you not go for it?
Hashtag analysis, Simply because Instagram currently does not give me complete rights to export data about which hashtag was clicked how many times on a post, which would make things interesting (it could be just a Iconosquare thing, not sure). Also, since posts these days may include even 20 hashtags in a go, so I believe that would be biased to account the reach or impressions on a post to specific hashtag than to the group which is of not much use.

### Any cool features/data points that you would suggest digital analysts to keep an eye on and why?
1. **Instagram Reach Percentage** = (Reach / Followers) * 100 -> Tells me how many of my followers are seeing the post. There is a catch though, it can be biased, there might be hashtags through which I might be reaching people, there might be influencers attached, whose audience may again be included in this calculation, still it tells me a lot about the approx. ratio of the of my Instagram reach.
2. **Best time to post chart** *(It is a graph that Iconosquare gives on a dashboard)* -> It is all about when my users are interacting with the posts and when would be some of the best timings of the week I should aim for to gain better engagement. It is real time and changes if start posting on a different time of the day. "The table below shows me each day and each time I have posted and how my audience interacted on each occasion. The bigger the circle, the more interaction I have received. As you can see below, the best times for me to post are grey circles and my posting habits. The black circles on the outer part of the chart are how often I post," Iconosquare. --> It can be found under engagement in the Analytics section.
