# Facebook Analytics

### What is Facebook Analytics?
Facebook Analytics is a digital analytics tool that can be used to analyze and report on how the social media marketing is performing through Facebook. It lets the user track KPIs on page performance, posts performance by giving various inbuilt user-friendly dashboards and by giving the ability to export raw data to build custom reports/dashboards.

### What do you like best?
The user-friendly environment it provides by breaking down the insights into meaningful segments and further answering questions like, where the page likes came from; what is post reach by comments, likes and shares; which external referrals drive the most audience to the page; and many more such interesting data points. Moreover, the best part is it gives me the ability to export raw data and create all these dashboards, so it gives me what it is showing me.

### Do you think there is still something missing?
Yes, it would have been nice to get comments data as well to analyze the positive and negative comments through natural language processing and understand page audience through perspective! 

### What is your primary role when analyzing/reporting data from Facebook?
As a Digital Marketing Data Analyst, I am analyzing the performance of posts, the page overall and how to gain bigger audience who is genuinely interested in our products and not just the picture and videos from the exotic destinations!!
