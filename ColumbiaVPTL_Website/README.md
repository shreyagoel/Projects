Shreya has managed the design and update of the website Columbia University VPTL since April 2017. Major suggestions made by her were considered positively for implementation by the Vice Provosts and Dirctors. These pages were updated from time to time. The Image on SARA page was clicked by Shreya and edited by herself using Photoshop to add the Watermark.

Although most of the pages of the pages were already present, Shreya redesigned them over time and built 4 pages from scratch for this particular website.
